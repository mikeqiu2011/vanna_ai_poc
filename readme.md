# SQLite + OpenLLaMA + ChromaDB

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to use the OpenLLaMA language model with ChromaDB and SQLite for efficient vector storage and retrieval.

## Prerequisites

Before running this notebook, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenLLaMA model (or any other compatible language model)
- ChromaDB
- SQLite

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

## Usage

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `sqlite-ollama-chromadb.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to set up the OpenLLaMA model, ChromaDB, and SQLite database.
4. Run the notebook cells to see the example code in action.

## What's Included

This notebook covers the following topics:

- Loading the OpenLLaMA language model
- Setting up ChromaDB with SQLite as the vector store
- Embedding and storing text data in the vector store
- Querying the vector store for similar text using natural language queries
- Retrieving and displaying the most relevant results

## Customization

You can modify the notebook to suit your specific use case. For example, you can change the language model, adjust the similarity threshold, or experiment with different types of data and queries.
